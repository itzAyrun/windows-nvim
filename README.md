# Neovim Configuration for Windows

This repository contains my personal Neovim configuration tailored for use on Windows. It includes settings, plugins, and customizations to enhance the Neovim experience for development on a Windows system.

This should also work on linux but I haven't tested this yet so I can't say that for sure. Why I haven't tested this yet on Linux? Because my laptop somehow doesn't want me to use Linux because of some weird TPM( Trusted Platform Module ) bug :(
